// Set up a basic scene with Three.js
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();

// Add objects, lights, etc., and animate the scene
// (Code for this can be more complex and depends on the specific animation you want to achieve)
